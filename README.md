# PacmanPathfinding-BFS-DFS-Astar
Assignment adapted from UC Berkeley and UW.

Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.


__***In this assignment I was given a pacman game with the goal to implement BFS, DFS, A*, heuristics for A*, and cost functions.__


The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need
to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you
can ignore.

Edited Files:

• search.py → Where all of your search algorithms will reside.

• searchAgents.py → Where all of your search-based agents will reside.
